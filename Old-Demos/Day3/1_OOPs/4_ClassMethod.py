# @staticmethod function is nothing more than a function defined inside a class. 
# It is callable without instantiating the class first. Itâ€™s definition is immutable via inheritance.

# @classmethod function also callable without instantiating the class, 
# but its definition follows Sub class, not Parent class, via inheritance
